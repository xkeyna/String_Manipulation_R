Early low-level dry air caused suppression of convection until mid to late afternoon. By 3pm, thunderstorms had started over much of the northern part of the area, and soon after extended to the southern half of the Central West. Initially, a Severe Thunderstorm Warning covered parts of the Gascoyne and Central West, but this was extended south to cover the Perth Metro and Mandurah after 3:30pm.%D %D While no observations of severe phenomena were observed for this event, radar indications strongly suggested severe thunderstorms occurred in the warning zone at times during the day. In the northern half of the warning area, storms around the Three Peaks township displayed VIL peaks of greater than 60kg/m2 (suggesting hail >= 2cm). Further south, a supercell developed near Yanchep with VIL peaks of greater than 110kg/m2. The widespread activity in the south generated a cold pool, which suppressed further storm activity; the STW for the Perth Metro was cancelled at 6:30pm.

61784,Rain,5042,27/04/2014 00:00,EXMOUTH,WA,-21.9569,114.1164,"A significant rain event occurred over central and southern WA, 26 April. The areas most affected by the event were the Northwest Cape region in the western Pilbara District, and parts of the Gascoyne district and Southwest Land Division, particularly the Central Wheat Belt. Flooding and property damage was reported between Exmouth and Coral Bay, and in an area between Toodyay and Quairading in the Central Wheat Belt District. Preliminary data suggests the highest 24 hour rainfall was observed at the AIMS observation site at Ningaloo Reef where 237.7mm fell in the 24 hour period to 9am on April 27, altough anecdotal evidence suggests as much as 400mm may have fallen in the Cape Range area to the west of Exmouth. While the heaviest falls during the 26th were confined to the NW Cape, the daily rainfall map shows widespread, significant falls over much of southern WA.%D Learmonth Airport received 154.4mm.%D %D The environment was primed for a significant rainfall event by the presence of deep-layer tropical moisture (WV satpic) advected by a high-amplitude mid-level trough (700hPa RH/Wind). Convection was initiated by a surface/low-level trough in the region (MSLP analysis), combined with strong upper divergence (CIMSS analysis). The NW Cape remained the focus of convection, with showers commencing in the early hours of the 26th and persisting for much of the day, only easing after about 2300WST as the focus of convection shifted further east. Steady rainfall rates of the order of 5-20mm/hour occurred throughout the day, increasing between 1800 and 2000WST as heavier showers and thunderstorms affected the area (see Learmonth radar loop). While rainfall about the NW Cape was convective in origin, further south the event was characterised by widespread rainfall driven by broadscale ascent (as indicated by EC warm-air advection analysis). %D Despite the large 24 hour totals, rainfall rates over shorter periods were generally below thresholds which would warrant the issuance of a Severe Weather Warning (SWW), particularly about the NW Cape region. Exmouth's 24hr total of 206mm has an ARI of 10-20 years. Learmonth also saw rainfall rates equal to a 10-20 year ARI: 185mm/24 hours and 158mm/12 hours (see IFD analysis). Analysis of the data at the AIMS site at Ningaloo did, however, show peak rainfall rates of greater than 10 year ARI for periods of 1-3 hours. Between 1700 and 2000WST, peak rates reached a 10-20yr ARI for 1 hour duration (54.3mm/1h, 1830-1930), and 20-50yr ARI for 2 hour rate (83mm/2hr, 1740-1940) and 3 hour rate (100.9mm/3hr, 1700-2000).

61785,Rain,5043,26/04/2014 00:00,CORRIGIN,WA,-32.3272,117.8747,"A significant rain event occurred over central and southern WA, 26 April. The areas most affected by the event were the Northwest Cape region in the western Pilbara District, and parts of the Gascoyne district and Southwest Land Division, particularly the Central Wheat Belt. Flooding and property damage was reported between Exmouth and Coral Bay, and in an area between Toodyay and Quairading in the Central Wheat Belt District. Preliminary data suggests the highest 24 hour rainfall was observed at the AIMS observation site at Ningaloo Reef where 237.7mm fell in the 24 hour period to 9am on April 27, altough anecdotal evidence suggests as much as 400mm may have fallen in the Cape Range area to the west of Exmouth. While the heaviest falls during the 26th were confined to the NW Cape, the daily rainfall map shows widespread, significant falls over much of southern WA.%D %D The environment was primed for a significant rainfall event by the presence of deep-layer tropical moisture (WV satpic) advected by a high-amplitude mid-level trough (700hPa RH/Wind). Convection was initiated by a surface/low-level trough in the region (MSLP analysis), combined with strong upper divergence (CIMSS analysis). The NW Cape remained the focus of convection, with showers commencing in the early hours of the 26th and persisting for much of the day, only easing after about 2300WST as the focus of convection shifted further east. Steady rainfall rates of the order of 5-20mm/hour occurred throughout the day, increasing between 1800 and 2000WST as heavier showers and thunderstorms affected the area (see Learmonth radar loop). While rainfall about the NW Cape was convective in origin, further south the event was characterised by widespread rainfall driven by broadscale ascent (as indicated by EC warm-air advection analysis).%D The largest rainfall totals in the 24 hours to 9am on the 27th, as measured at BoM observation sites, are listed below. %D Despite the large 24 hour totals, rainfall rates over shorter periods were generally below thresholds which would warrant the issuance of a Severe Weather Warning (SWW), particularly about the NW Cape region. Exmouth's 24hr total of 206mm has an ARI of 10-20 years. Learmonth also saw rainfall rates equal to a 10-20 year ARI: 185mm/24 hours and 158mm/12 hours (see IFD analysis). Analysis of the data at the AIMS site at Ningaloo did, however, show peak rainfall rates of greater than 10 year ARI for periods of 1-3 hours. Between 1700 and 2000WST, peak rates reached a 10-20yr ARI for 1 hour duration (54.3mm/1h, 1830-1930), and 20-50yr ARI for 2 hour rate (83mm/2hr, 1740-1940) and 3 hour rate (100.9mm/3hr, 1700-2000). Longer-term rainfall rates had longer ARI with 6, 12 and 24 hour rates having an ARI of 50-100 years. Based on IFD analysis of short-term rainfall rates, rainfall was closer to SWW thresholds in the south of the state.

Emergency services received more than 40 calls for help in the metropolitan area and South West region. Damage was reported in Busselton, Bunbury and Augusta, as well as the Perth metro area. Call outs were mostly for minor flooding and tree/roof damage. The approach of the front produced a prolonged period of northerly winds down the west coast which resulted in a rise of about 60cm in the sea level along the west coast. This surge combined with the normal high tide to produce tide levels well above HAT in many places but particulalry Busselton where the tide reached 2m, about 60 cm above HAT.

However, Lyons River Crossing (inland of Carnarvon) had 80mm in 12 hours which has an ARI of 10-20 years, while the Cascades (east of Ravensthorpe) had 32mm in 3 hours, on the morning of the 31st, which equates to a 1 in 10 year ARI.%D %D                                            Prcp      Perd                                                               %D Station Name          Stn no Date          (mm)  QF (days)                                                              %D -------------------- ------- ----------- ------ --- ------                                                              %D ONSLOW AIRPORT        005017 31-Mar-2015  106.0  00      1                                                              %D RED HILL              005022 31-Mar-2015   83.4  00      1                                                              %D LYONS RIVER CROSSING  506013 31-Mar-2015   78.6  00      1                                                              %D KOOLINE               005006 31-Mar-2015   77.0  00      1                                                              %D BURRINGURRAH AIRSTRI  007210 31-Mar-2015   74.8  00      1                                                              %D LYONS RIVER AIRSTRIP  006112 31-Mar-2015   71.8  00      1                                                              %D EMU CREEK STATION     006072 31-Mar-2015   69.6  00      1                                                              %D MOUNT AUGUSTUS        007053 31-Mar-2015   65.1  00      1                                                              %D MOUNT AUGUSTUS AIRST  007208 31-Mar-2015   64.2  00      1                                                              %D MINNIE CREEK          006040 31-Mar-2015   64.0  00      1                                                              %D MOOLOO DOWNS          006106 31-Mar-2015   63.0  00      1                                                              %D COBRA AIRSTRIP        007209 31-Mar-2015   62.2  00      1                                                              %D MINNIE CREEK AIRSTRI  006104 31-Mar-2015   60.6  00      1                                                              %D YALLEEN               005029 31-Mar-2015   56.0  00      1                                                              %D YARRALOOLA HOMESTEAD  005032 31-Mar-2015   53.0  00      1                                                              %D CHEELA PLAINS         005095 31-Mar-2015   52.0  00      1                                                              %D LORT RIVER            012223 31-Mar-2015   52.0  00      1                                                              %D CASCADE (DAFWA)       512021 31-Mar-2015   51.8  00      1                                                              %D LANDOR AIRSTRIP       007207 31-Mar-2015   51.2  00      1                                                              %D",,,,,,
